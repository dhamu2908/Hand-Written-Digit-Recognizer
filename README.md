Hand Writen Digit Recognizer allows users to draw a handwritten digit on a graphical interface and classify it using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, to recognize digits from 0 to 9. The project utilizes Python with TensorFlow for the deep learning model and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).
